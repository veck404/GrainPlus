## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo (replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username after you upload it).
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Grain-.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
    ```sh
    cd Grain+
    ```
3.  Install NPM packages.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the app in development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload automatically when you make edits.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```sh
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure. A key directory to note is:

- `src/data/`: This folder contains JavaScript files that export data arrays and objects. This approach centralizes the site's content (text, links, image paths), making it easy to manage and update without touching the component logic.
